First, I had to create a rock, paper, scissors game that was only played in the console. After this I was introduced to 
modifying html and css, while using JavaScript. The biggest struggle was to figure out how to end the game when the user
or pc finally has gotten five points. It was fun to style the end message, and it came as a relieve that I found it to be 
relatively easy to configure the 'play again' button and remove all the added style.
